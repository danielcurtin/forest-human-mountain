### Abstract
This app is a rebuild of the classic Rock Paper Scissors game, with the user being able to play against a computer. This app lets the user customize their avatar and keeps track of their, and the computers, wins individually each session. The user can choose to play the classic 3 choice version, or can opt to play the more difficult 5 choice version for more of a challenge - double the chance to win, but also double the chance to lose. Wins will be tracked across versions, and it's clear as to who chose what and who won each round.

### Context
This project took ~20-25 hours to complete, and I started it at 5 weeks into the Frontend Engineering Program.

### Learning Goals
- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
  - DRY JavaScript
  - Event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### Wins + Challenges
My biggest challenge and win by far was working out a mathematical solution to the logic behind the winner/loser of the game. That took a lot of verbal and visual mapping, and you can actually see my general thought process / layout [here](https://replit.com/@DanielCurtin/RPS-logic#index.js). The general outcome though, is that the game is now fully dynamic so that the more difficult version can be expanded if so desired, and you wouldn't have to add any logic to determine who won or lost, which was very satisfying.
